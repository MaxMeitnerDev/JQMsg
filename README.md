# **ᐅ Description**
Good day! This is my first plugin. The essence of this plugin is that thanks to it you can add custom global and personal messages when joining and disconnecting.
My plugin differs from the others in that it can add a personal message both for those who have connected to the server for the first time and for those who have already connected more than once. You can also disable any functions you don't need in my plugin. HEX support is available. For the plugin to work, you need the minecraft server version 1.8+. You can get help on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/QVU7X9852n).

### **ᐅ Commands and Permissions**
+ **/jqmsg reload** - Reload the plugin (*jqmsg.reload*).
